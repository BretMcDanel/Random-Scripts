## Introduction
These are random things that I felt like sharing.  

# Files
## Powershell
* [Compile-CSharp.ps1](Compile-CSharp.ps1) - Rudimentary C# compiler.  Mostly useful for pentesting apps, real dev should be done in a real compiler
* [PS_Persistence_Add-Monitor.ps1](PS_Persistence_Add-Monitor.ps1) - Based on Brady Bloxham's [Defcon 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2Hv7J9fvk) persistence technique.
* [Search-CertTransparency.ps1](Search-CertTransparency.ps1) - Search the Certificate Transparency Logs for a given domain, useful for footprinting or periodic checks on your own domain to see if anyone is abusing dangling DNS records.
